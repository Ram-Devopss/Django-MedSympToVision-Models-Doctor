# MedSympToVision

MedSympToVision is a cutting-edge web application designed to assist patients in identifying diseases quickly and efficiently using deep learning models. This platform supports multiple input formats, including symptoms, X-ray images, and disease descriptions, providing accurate predictions for better healthcare decisions.

## Features

1. **Disease Prediction by Symptoms**  
   Enter up to 5 symptoms, and the model will predict potential diseases.
   
2. **X-ray Disease Prediction**  
   Upload an X-ray image, and the platform will predict the associated disease using an advanced image prediction model.
   
3. **Disease Name Prediction by Description**  
   Upload a description or image of a disease, and the platform will predict the likely disease name.

## Deep Learning Models Used

We have integrated the following machine learning models to ensure high accuracy in disease predictions:

- **Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **XGBoost**

These models have been fine-tuned and trained to deliver reliable predictions for various disease types.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:


1. **Install the dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. **Migrate the database**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

3. **Run the development server**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

4. **Access the site**  
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage

- For **symptom-based predictions**, go to the "Symptom Predictor" page and enter up to 5 symptoms.
- To **predict diseases using X-rays**, visit the "X-ray Prediction" page, and upload the X-ray image.
- For **disease name prediction** by description or image, use the "Disease Predictor" section.

## How it Works

The application utilizes a combination of machine learning algorithms for each of the prediction types:

1. **Naive Bayes**: Helps classify diseases based on symptoms provided by the user.
2. **Random Forest**: Enhances accuracy in predictions by analyzing different decision paths.
3. **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification, especially effective in disease identification.
4. **Decision Trees**: Supports decision-making based on disease descriptions.
5. **XGBoost**: Optimized for speed and accuracy, particularly useful in image classification.
